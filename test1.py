'''
test1.py has 2 functions to generate random unique customer_ids and product_ids

#
# (A) Additional assumptions:
#
# Requirements on length and format of order_id, customer_id and product_id are not stated.
# These assumptions are used:
# - order_id (in test2.py) will be an integer from 0 to 999 in increment of 1.
# - customer_id will be a unique randomized token/string of 12 hexadecimal digit (0-f)
# - product_id will be a string consists of a character (either "c", "b", "r" or "z") followed by a unique 7 digit number (0-9)
#   as first character will be used to identify the category:
#   - c - cooked food
#   - b - breakfast food
#   - r - reduced food
#   - z - Null / None / Others
#

#
# (B) customer_id_gen function is called by main.py
#     returning a list of customer_id
#

#     returning a list of customer_id
