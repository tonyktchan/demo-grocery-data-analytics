'''
(I) Python files required to generate dataset are:
- main.py
- test1.py, test2.py and test3.py have various functions and imported by main.py 
- test4.py contains the unit tests for the output csv files 

   To run : python -m main

(II) Output files are :
- products.csv - 20 unique product_ids with categories
- order_by_customer.csv - 1,000 grocery orders by 20 customers
  Assumptions: please note that each order can include up 3 x product_ids.
               The max number of sold units for each product_id is 4 
  Therefore, the number of rows/records is estimated to be 1,000 x ((1+2+3)/3) = 2,000 rows/records

- historical_orders.csv - contains the sorted order_by_customer.csv in chronological order and customer_id
- subtotal.csv - is the running subtotal for all customers in the previous year (365 days)

(III) To run unit tests:  python -m test4
   If all tests are successful, the generated csv files/dataset are ready to use

#
# (D) The function will generate 1,000 orders (NUM_ORDER = 1000) 
#     happended within the previous year (365 days).
#
#     Each order consists of at least one or more product_id and the associated quantity.
#     To facilitate the following dataset generation, a generated order is flattened 
#     to whole single product_id and quantity associated
#     Each record within the same order, has the following schema/fields:
#     - unique order_id from 1 to 1000
#     - unique customer_id 
#     - a date within the last year (365 days) this order is made/completed - key/value
#     - product_id - randomly picked up from product_list
#     - quantity - quantity of the product in this order
#
#      Additional assumptions:
#      - each order will have a maximum of 3 product_id's (max 3 rows to constitute an order)
#      - the assumed maximum of quantity is 4 (valid range is 1-4) for each product_id in a record/sub-order
#
#       The output is historical_orders.csv -
#       - sorted first by order_date and second by customer_id
#       - since NUM_ORDER = 1000 and MAX_PRODUCTS = 3
#         the average no. of generated rows is 1000 * avg(1,2,3) = 2000 rows
#

df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(historical_orders)

df.set_index("order_id", inplace=True)


# overwrite previous one if exists
df.to_csv("historical_orders.csv")


# (E) Final part is to generate running subtotal per customer after each order (consist of multiple records / each record for 1 product_id)
#     Please note that as the prev_xxx_count and this_order_xxx_count exclude those under 'None' category
#  
#     The output is subtotal.csv - sorted record first on customer_id and order_id (which is order chronologically)

#
# (F) Unit Testing - check the following
#
#     Please use the test4.py to perform the unit testing on the output files
#     command : python -m test4
#
#     This is the end of the required dataset generation
